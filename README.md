# Vendor_Performance_Analysis

## Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

1. Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.

2. Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.

3. Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.

4. Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.

5. Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

## Analysis Results:

● Re-evaluate pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands to boost sales volume without sacrificing profitability.
● Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce dependency on a few suppliers and mitigate supply chain risks.
● Leverage bulk purchasing advantages to maintain competitive pricing while optimizing inventory management.
● Optimize slow-moving inventory by adjusting purchase quantities, launching clearance sales, or revising storage strategies.
● Enhance marketing and distribution strategies for low-performing vendors to drive higher sales volumes without compromising profit margins.
● By implementing these recommendations, the company can achieve sustainable profitability, mitigate risks, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
